Cloud computing is the development of distributed and parallel computing that seeks to provide a new model of business computing by automating services and efficiently storing proprietary data. Cloud bursting is one of the cloud computing techniques that adopts the hybrid cloud model which seeks to expand the resources of a private cloud through the integration with a public cloud infrastructure. In this paper, the viability of cloud bursting is experimented and an attempt to integrate AWS EC2 onto an Openstack cloud environment using the Openstack OMNI driver is conducted.
